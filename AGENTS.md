# ENAC GSEA English Semester 3 — AI Agent Guidelines & Architecture Rules

This repository houses the official **Semester 1 English Learning Portal and SCORM 1.2 Package** for ENAC (École Nationale de l'Aviation Civile). It serves as both the live learning interface for students and a reusable template platform for future cohorts and semesters.

---

## 1. System Architecture & Invariant Rules (Permanent)

These rules apply across all cohorts and must be strictly maintained during any modification or refactoring:

### A. SCORM 1.2 Strict Offline Self-Containment
- **Zero External Dependencies**: The package must run completely offline within LMS environments (ENAC Moodle / eCampus). Do not use external CDNs for scripts, fonts, icons, or stylesheets.
- **Asset Indexing**: All distributed assets (HTML, compiled CSS, local scripts, local images, audio, PDFs) must be tracked in `imsmanifest.xml`.
- **Packaging Integrity**: Every file listed in `imsmanifest.xml` must exist on disk. Use `npm run package` to automatically compile minified CSS, validate all manifest assets, and bundle `dist/GSEA_Semester_1_SCORM.zip`.

### B. Dual-File Admin Hub Synchronization
Course administration (student lists, teacher assignments, weekly schedules, and Formative Evaluation rotas) exists in **two interfaces**:
1. **In-Deck Slide-Over Drawer**: Embedded in `index.html` (triggered via Card 07).
2. **Standalone Admin Portal**: Located in `admin.html`.

> **CRITICAL RULE**: Whenever changes are made to timetables, session dates, room allocations, student pairings, or teacher assignments, both `index.html` and `admin.html` **must** be updated simultaneously to maintain complete parity.

### C. Build & Deployment Runbook
- **Source Architecture**:
  - The human-editable code lives cleanly in modular source files under `src/`:
    - `src/template.html`: Base application HTML shell
    - `src/js/01-scorm-engine.js`: SCORM 1.2 runtime API
    - `src/js/02-config.js`: Course & program configuration
    - `src/js/03-core-deck.js`: Navigation, deck state, themes, and audio controllers
    - `src/js/04-templates-dispatcher.js`: Lesson content & activity instruction dispatcher
    - `src/js/05-templates-mod1.js`: Module 1 lesson content (AAS & AG)
    - `src/js/06-templates-ag2.js`: Module 2 General English lesson content
    - `src/js/07-templates-ag3.js`: Module 3 General English lesson content
    - `src/js/08-templates-aas2.js`: Module 2 Aeronautical English lesson content
    - `src/js/09-templates-materials-ddrs.js`: Vocabulary revision, study materials, TOEIC, and DDRS tabs
    - `src/js/10-fe-guidelines.js`: Formative evaluation guidelines, rubrics, and criteria
    - `src/js/11-admin-hub.js`: Promotion rosters, timetables, rota schedules, and immersion hub
    - `src/js/12-footer-init.js`: Interactive quiz handlers and DOMContentLoaded initialization
- **Build & Package (Mandatory SCORM + `.iso` + `.dmg` Rebuild)**:
  - **CRITICAL RULE**: Every time code, content, or assets are updated, the `.iso` (`GSEA_Semester_X_Offline.iso`) and `.dmg` (`GSEA_Semester_X_Mac.dmg`) offline disk images **must** be rebuilt alongside the SCORM `.zip` package.
  - `npm run build`: Compiles `src/` modules into `index.html` and builds minified CSS.
  - `npm run package`:
  ```bash
  npm run package
  ```
  *(Automatically runs `package-scorm.js` AND `package-iso.js`: compiles `src/` into `index.html`, compiles Tailwind CSS v4 minified, validates manifest integrity, outputs the SCORM `.zip`, and rebuilds both the `.iso` and `.dmg` offline installers).*
  - `npm run package:iso`: Rebuilds the `.iso` and `.dmg` offline installers standalone.
- **Release Versioning**:
  - Main production code lives on branch `main`.
  - Production releases are tagged with `v1.2.0-live` (or semantic version increments) and pushed with:
    ```bash
    git push origin main --force --tags
    ```

### D. Mandatory Pre-Implementation Response & Approval Gate
- **No Direct Changes Without Prior Response**: ALL questions, requests, or suggested modifications from the user require a thorough review, report, and recommendation from the AI assistant **BEFORE** implementing any changes.
- **Proceed / Ignore Prompt**: Every proposal or review must conclude with an explicit prompt asking the user whether to **proceed or ignore/adjust** (e.g. *"Please let me know if you would like me to proceed with these changes, or ignore/adjust."*).
- **Explicit Confirmation Required**: The assistant must wait for explicit approval (such as *"Proceed"*, *"Approved"*, or further instructions) before modifying any codebase files.

### E. Automated Project Backups (`backup1`, `backup2` & `backup3`)
- **`backup1` Trigger**: Whenever the user sends `backup1`, the assistant immediately runs `npm run backup1` (or `node scripts/backup.js semester1`) to bundle a full dated archive into `/Users/philparris/Documents/moodle_backups/GSEA_semester_1/` and confirms the file path and archive size.
- **`backup2` Trigger**: Whenever the user sends `backup2`, the assistant immediately runs `npm run backup2` (or `node scripts/backup.js semester2`) to bundle a full dated archive into `/Users/philparris/Documents/moodle_backups/GSEA_semester_2/` and confirms the file path and archive size.
- **`backup3` Trigger**: Whenever the user sends `backup3`, the assistant immediately runs `npm run backup3` (or `node scripts/backup.js semester3`) to bundle a full dated archive into `/Users/philparris/Documents/moodle_backups/GSEA_semester_3/` and confirms the file path and archive size.
- **Archive Convention**: Archives are named `GSEA_Semester_X_backup_YYYY-MM-DD_HHmm.zip`, containing the full project source and compiled assets while omitting `node_modules` and `.git`.

### F. Cross-Project Rule, Feature & Tooling Synchronization (Tri-Project Invariant)
- **Mandatory Tri-Project Propagation**: Whenever an architectural rule, governance guideline, operational command (e.g. `backup1`/`backup2`/`backup3`), utility script, **shared platform feature, portfolio enhancement, or UI workflow improvement** is created or updated in any semester, the assistant MUST automatically evaluate and synchronize that improvement across all three repositories (`GSEA_semester_1`, `GSEA_semester_2`, and `GSEA_semester_3`) within the same session (omitting only content that is strictly semester-specific, such as module lesson topics).

### G. Automatic Atomic Commit & Push Protocol
- **Single-Step Remote Synchronization**: Whenever the user instructs the assistant to `"Commit"` or `"Commit changes"`, the assistant MUST automatically execute **both** `git commit` AND `git push origin main` together in one seamless step, ensuring GitHub and GitHub Pages stay continuously synchronized with local progress.

### H. Student Privacy, Pseudonymization & Offline Moodle Packaging Protocol
- **Strict Codebase Anonymity**: The Git codebase (`src/`, `admin.html`, `index.html`) must NEVER contain real student names or PII. All student rosters and FE evaluation rotas must use anonymous identifiers (`GRPA001`–`GRPA010`, `GRPB001`–`GRPB009`).
- **Zero Student PII in AI Chat**: Real student names must NEVER be entered, printed, or output in the AI chat conversation or prompt history. All conversational responses, tables, summaries, logs, and examples must strictly and exclusively use anonymous student identifiers (`GRPA001`–`GRPB009`). Real student identities reside exclusively within local `students.private.json` files on the instructor's local machine for offline client-side package injection.
- **Private Mapping Security**: Real student names are stored exclusively in the local file `students.private.json`, which is permanently listed in `.gitignore` and must never be committed to Git. A placeholder template `students.private.example.json` is tracked by Git for onboarding.
- **Dual Packaging Pipelines**:
  1. `npm run package`: Generates `dist/GSEA_Semester_X_SCORM.zip` with 100% anonymous identifiers (safe for Git, GitHub Pages, and AI cloud pair-programming).
  2. `npm run package:moodle`: Automatically injects real student names from `students.private.json` strictly into the output zip `dist/GSEA_Semester_X_SCORM_MOODLE.zip` for direct upload to ENAC Moodle / eCampus, leaving working directory files completely anonymous.

### I. Plain English & Global B2 Accessibility (Zero Pedagogical or Academic Jargon)
- **Language Lessons, Not Technical Instruction**: All sessions are communicative, spoken English lessons designed to build confidence, practical fluency, and real-world conversation skills. They are NOT theoretical linguistics lectures, teacher-training courses, or technical instruction sessions.
- **Universal B2 Understandability**: All instructions—both student-facing worksheets and teacher notes—must use clear, simple, plain English easily understood by any B2 learner worldwide.
- **Strictly Forbidden Academic / Linguistic Jargon**:
  - Never use pedagogical meta-labels or academic jargon such as: `"scaffolding phrases"`, `"pedagogical scaffolding"`, `"discourse markers"`, `"syntactic complexity"`, `"prepositional dependency"`, `"distractor patterns"`, `"subject-auxiliary inversion"`, `"concessive signposts"`, or `"opinion signposts"`.
  - Always replace with direct, human-friendly terms: `"Useful phrases"`, `"Useful storytelling words"`, `"Example story"`, `"Key phrases for expressing opinions"`, `"Connecting words"`, `"Sentence patterns"`.
- **Simple, Actionable Steps**: Keep all task instructions concise, direct, and focused on spoken communication, peer interaction, and listening.
- **Strict Prohibition of the Term 'Faculty'**:
  - Never use the word `"faculty"` across any UI labels, headings, cards, badges, documentation, teacher portals, student worksheets, or prompt responses.
  - Always use clear, plain, human-friendly terms instead: `"Teachers"`, `"Teaching Team"`, `"Teaching Staff"`, `"Teacher Notes"`, `"Teaching Notes"`, or `"Course Administration"`.

### J. Invisible Copyright & Cryptographic Authorship Integrity
- **Moral Rights & Authorship**: All materials are protected under French Intellectual Property law (Articles L.111-1 & L.121-1 CPI) with author attribution to **Phil PARRIS**.
- **100% Invisible On Screen**: No visible copyright notices or disclaimers clutter student or faculty UI. All protections reside under the hood via `<meta>` tags, HTML comment blocks, frozen JavaScript tokens (`window.__GSEA_PROGRAMME_AUTH`), root `COPYRIGHT.md`, and cryptographic `CHECKSUMS.sha256`.
- **INPI e-Soleau Archival Tool**: Run `npm run package:esoleau` to bundle the complete human-editable source tree into `dist/GSEA_Semester_X_INPI_eSoleau_YYYY-MM-DD.zip` for instant certified timestamping (*date certaine*) on [inpi.fr](https://www.inpi.fr).

### K. `Promo Admin` & `Semester X Update` Rapid Cohort & Faculty Configuration Protocol
- **`Semester X Update` Trigger (`PROMO_SETUP.private.md` — Auto-Repackage + Auto-Commit & Push)**: Whenever the user edits `PROMO_SETUP.private.md` and sends `Semester 1 Update`, `Semester 2 Update`, or `Semester 3 Update`, the assistant immediately:
  1. Runs `npm run promo:update` (`node scripts/update-promo.js && npm run package && npm run package:moodle`), which reads `PROMO_SETUP.private.md`, pulls live session titles from `src/js/02-config.js`, updates `students.private.json`, updates the bounded `ADMIN_PROMO_CONFIG` blocks in `src/js/11-admin-hub.js` and `admin.html`, updates `portfolio.html`, and rebuilds all 4 packages (`SCORM.zip`, `SCORM_MOODLE.zip`, `.iso`, `.dmg`).
  2. Automatically executes `git commit` AND `git push origin main` in the same step so the anonymized updates are immediately synchronized to GitHub.
- **Inline Trigger Shorthand (`Promo Admin`)**: Whenever the user sends a `Promo Admin` instruction (e.g., `Promo Admin: Promotion GSEA25A, Semester 3, Groups 3, A - 10 B - 10 C - 10, Teachers AG 0 AT 3 [optional teacher names]`), the assistant automatically updates all cohort, group, student roster, and faculty structures across the entire project.
- **Permanent Semester Track Invariants (Never Changes)**:
  - **Semester 1**: Always **AG** + **AT** (`LV101E` & `LV121E`)
  - **Semester 2**: Always **AG** + **AAS** (`LV102E` & `LV122E`)
  - **Semester 3**: Always **AT** only (`LV125E`, `AG` disabled) — **CRITICAL TERMINOLOGY RULE**: Never use `"Aeronautical English"` in Semester 3; always use **`Technical English`** or **`AT`**.
  - **Semester 4**: Always **AP** only (`AG` disabled)
- **Group Scaling (1 to 4 Groups Max: `A`, `B`, `C`, `D`)**:
  - Supports up to 4 groups (`Group A`, `Group B`, `Group C`, `Group D`).
  - Automatically generates anonymous student IDs (`GRPA001`–`GRPA0XX`, `GRPB001`–`GRPB0XX`, `GRPC001`–`GRPC0XX`, `GRPD001`–`GRPD0XX`), calculates total promotion headcount, and computes the FE pair/trio slot mix per group.
- **Teacher Assignments (`Teachers`)**:
  - Parses teacher counts per track (e.g., `Teachers AG 0 AT 3` or `Teachers AG 2 AT 2`) and optional teacher names per group (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`).
  - If teacher names are omitted, defaults to clean placeholders (`Teacher A (TBC)`, `Teacher B (TBC)`, `Teacher C (TBC)`, `Teacher D (TBC)`).
  - If a track has `0` teachers (e.g., `AG 0` in Semester 3 or 4), its faculty card is omitted from the Class Groups & Teachers page.
- **Files Synchronized Automatically**:
  1. `src/template.html` (Flight Deck HUD callsign badge)
  2. `src/js/02-config.js` & `src/js/03-core-deck.js` (Admin card tag, description, and dock title)
  3. `src/js/11-admin-hub.js` (In-Deck Admin Hub: overview, faculty cards, and student group tables)
  4. `admin.html` (Standalone Admin Portal: overview, faculty cards, and student group tables)
  5. `portfolio.html` & `students.private.example.json` (Student `<optgroup>` selectors and private mapping template)
  6. Runs `npm run package` to rebuild `index.html`, `output.css`, the SCORM `.zip`, `.iso`, and `.dmg`.

### L. Calendar & Deck Session Title Parity Invariant (Cross-Semester Permanent Rule)
- **1:1 Strict Title Parity**: The lesson titles displayed in the weekly course calendar (`ADMIN_CALENDAR_SCHEDULES` in both `src/js/11-admin-hub.js` and `admin.html`) must **strictly mirror and maintain 1:1 parity** with the session titles and class titles in each deck card (`src/js/02-config.js`, `data/course-data.js`, and the digital worksheets).
- **Mandatory Dual-File Synchronization**: Whenever a session title is modified, refined, or retitled in any deck card, the corresponding calendar entries in both `src/js/11-admin-hub.js` and `admin.html` **must** be updated concurrently to match exactly.

### M. `Semester X Portfolio Summary` & `Semester X Dual Portfolio Update` Automated Cohort Insights Protocol
- **Dual-Portal Update Trigger (`Semester 3 Dual Portfolio Update`)**: Whenever the user sends `Semester 3 Dual Portfolio Update` (or `Semester 3 Full Portfolio Update` / `Dual Portfolio Update S3`, with a CSV attached or pasted), the assistant:
  1. Writes the raw CSV into BOTH `GSEA_semester_3/data/portfolio-latest.csv` AND `GSEA_teachers/data/portfolio-s3-latest.csv` (both strictly git-ignored).
  2. In `GSEA_semester_3`: Runs `npm run portfolio:summary` (`node scripts/update-portfolio-summary.js && npm run package && npm run package:moodle`), updating Card 08/09, rebuilding all 4 packages (`SCORM.zip`, `SCORM_MOODLE.zip`, `.iso`, `.dmg`), and executing `git commit && git push origin main`.
  3. In `GSEA_teachers`: Runs `npm run portfolio:s3` (`node scripts/update-portfolio.js 3 && npm run package`), updating Teachers Hub, rebuilding all 3 packages (`SCORM.zip`, `.iso`, `.dmg`), and executing `git commit && git push origin main`.
  4. Confirms both repositories updated and synchronized live to GitHub in a single consolidated report.
- **Single Deck Trigger (`Semester 3 Portfolio Summary`)**: Whenever the user sends `Semester 3 Portfolio Summary` (with a CSV or spreadsheet attached or pasted), the assistant:
  1. Writes the raw CSV into `data/portfolio-latest.csv` (which is permanently listed in `.gitignore` to protect student security codes and PII).
  2. Runs `npm run portfolio:summary` (`node scripts/update-portfolio-summary.js && npm run package && npm run package:moodle`), which extracts top keywords, grammar pitfalls, student reflections, and FE readiness scores, updates `data/portfolio-summary-s1.json`, synchronizes `PORTFOLIO_SUMMARY_DATA` in `src/js/11-admin-hub.js`, and rebuilds all packages (`SCORM.zip`, `SCORM_MOODLE.zip`, `.iso`, `.dmg`).
  3. Automatically executes `git commit` AND `git push origin main` in the same step.
- **Cumulative Whole-Semester Insights & Authentic Peer Voices Protocol**:
  - The Portfolio Summary tab must **represent cumulative learning across the entire semester** (spanning Module 1, Module 2, and Module 3) rather than discarding earlier foundations when new sessions begin.
  - **Usability & Structure**: Rich, well-spaced modular digest that remains clear and skimmable across both mobile and desktop.
  - **Top Buzzwords**: Up to **12 to 16 top terms across the semester** (~4 to 5 core terms per module/topic across both tracks), prioritizing high-frequency consensus terms with clear, 1-sentence operational definitions.
  - **Grammar & Pronunciation Traps**: Up to **5 to 6 high-frequency spoken traps or golden rules**, covering pronunciation phonetics, countable/uncountable nouns, syntax, and operational distinctions, formatted with punchy ❌ Wrong vs ✅ Right comparisons.
  - **Cohort Reflections**: Up to **3 key strengths**, **3 growth areas**, and **1 actionable FE advice bullet point**.
  - **Authentic Cohort Voices (Verbatim Quotes)**: Include **2 to 4 authentic, anonymized verbatim student quotes** directly excerpted from student portfolio reflections, highlighting real classroom breakthroughs, speaking anxieties, or independent study strategies. Quotes must NEVER contain student names, real identifiers, or security codes.
  - **Track Tagging**: Every buzzword, grammar trap, and verbatim quote must carry a clean track tag (`track: "at"`, `track: "ag"`, or `track: "all"`) to power the mobile-optimized 3-way segmented filter bar (`🌐 All` • `✈️ AT` • `🗣️ AG`).

### N. Photography Visuals Integrity & Image Asset Protection Invariant
- **Protected Master Photography Assets**: All card visuals, especially `images/fe_progress_check.jpg` (Card 05 Formative Evaluation seminar photo) and `images/semester_objectives.jpg` (Card 08 Student Guide & Objectives classroom photo), are **permanent, high-resolution photography assets**.
- **Strictly Forbidden Optimization Downgrades**: Never delete, compress down to flat clipart, or swap `.jpg` photo assets with legacy flat `.png` icons (`fe_progress_check.png`, `semester_objectives.png`) under the guise of build size reduction or package optimization. The legacy `.png` clipart files are purged from the repository and must never be reintroduced.

### O. `Media Update` Automated Weekly Curation Protocol (Media Update)
- **Weekly Media Curation Trigger (`Media Update`)**: Whenever the user sends `Media Update` (with a CSV attached, pasted in chat, or written to `data/media-latest.csv`):
  1. Ingest `data/media-latest.csv` containing:
     - 1 Up Next notice/statement (headline, week tag, teaching note).
     - 2 BBC article links (Aviation Safety / AT and Tourism & Leisure / AG, with title, summary, link).
     - 3 IMDb film recommendations (General Culture & Cinema: title, country/genre tag, credits, synopsis, link).
  2. Parse and synchronize the dynamic media blocks bounded by `<!-- MEDIA_UPDATE_START -->` and `<!-- MEDIA_UPDATE_END -->` in `GSEA_teachers/index.html` (via `npm run media:update` or `node scripts/update-media.js`).
  3. Rebuild minified Tailwind CSS and all 3 distribution packages (`dist/GSEA_Teachers_SCORM.zip`, `.iso`, `.dmg`).
  4. Automatically execute `git commit` AND `git push origin main` in the same step.
- **General Culture Focus**: Film recommendations are curated for broad cultural perspective, creative storytelling, and critical reflection beyond language boundaries, and are not restricted to English-language cinema.
- **Privacy & Clean Code Invariants**: Raw `data/*.csv` files remain in `.gitignore`. Example template is tracked at `data/media-latest.example.csv`. Prohibited term `"faculty"` must never appear in generated copy or UI.

### P. Session Objectives & Lesson Plan Title Invariant (Tri-Project Permanent Invariant)
- **Objectives Title Syntax**: All session objectives titles must follow the strict format:
  `Session X Objectives - [Topic Title]`
  *(Never use trailing suffix `Session X - [Topic] Objectives`).*
- **Lesson Plan Title Syntax**: All session lesson plan titles must follow:
  `Session X Lesson Plan - [Topic Title] (2 Hours)` or `Session X Lesson Plan (2 Hours)`.
- **Tri-Project Consistency**: This rule applies permanently across `GSEA_semester_1`, `GSEA_semester_2`, and `GSEA_semester_3`.

### Q. Teacher Autonomy & Zero Classroom Timings Invariant (Tri-Project Permanent Invariant)
- **Zero Classroom Minute Breakdowns**: All lesson plans, student worksheets, activities, and teacher facilitation notes must strictly omit rigid minute breakdowns and timestamps (e.g., never include `00–25`, `25–50`, `(20 mins)`, `(30 mins)`, `(45 mins)`).
- **Pedagogical Stage Progression (`Part 1`–`Part 4` / `Step 1`–`Step 4`)**: All activities must be organized by clean, sequential pedagogical stages (e.g., `Part 1`, `Part 2`, `Part 3`, `Part 4` or `Step 1`, `Step 2`).
- **Complete Teacher Pacing Autonomy**: Pacing, dwell time, and discussion depth are determined entirely by the classroom teacher based on real-time classroom dynamics, student speaking confidence, and communicative flow.
- **Plain English Non-Technical Instructions**: All instructions for students and teachers must use clear, accessible, non-technical B2 English (e.g., `"Teacher Tips & Speaking Prompts"` instead of `"Timing Cues"` or pedagogical jargon per Rule 1.I).
- **Session Block Title Retention**: Per Rule 1.P, the top-level lesson plan title retains its standard university schedule block designation (e.g., `Session X Lesson Plan - [Topic Title] (2 Hours)`), while all internal activity timings are strictly omitted.


### S. Automated Link Verification & In-Deck Full-Text Article Reader Invariant (Tri-Project Permanent Invariant)
- **Zero Broken Links Guarantee (`npm run verify:links`)**: Every external link included in `data/course-data.js` (under `materials.articles` or `materials.resources` / `portals`) must be verified via the automated link checking script `scripts/verify-links.js` before release. Broken URLs, 404s, or endpoints triggering crawler blocks must be updated to verified canonical endpoints.
- **In-Deck Full-Text Article Reader (`window.openArticleReader`)**: To preserve SCORM 1.2 strict offline self-containment (Rule 1.A) and guarantee that students never encounter external 404s, login paywalls, or offline connection errors during class, clicking `Read Article →` on any technical article card opens an in-deck reading modal directly inside the portal. The modal displays the complete B1/B2 article text, operational takeaways, and spoken technical vocabulary in context, while providing a clean secondary link to the official external source.
- **Polymorphic Property Fallbacks**: All article renderers must safely handle both naming conventions (`heading || title`, `snippet || summary || desc`, `url || link`) to ensure zero `undefined` values appear on screen.
- **Automated Validation Invariant**: Running `npm run verify:links` is part of the standard pre-flight packaging checklist across all three semesters (`GSEA_semester_1`, `GSEA_semester_2`, and `GSEA_semester_3`).

### R. 100% Paperless Digital-First Architecture & Zero Printable Materials Invariant (Tri-Project Permanent Invariant)
- **Zero Physical Printouts**: No lesson plan, student worksheet, role-play activity, teacher facilitation note, or evaluation rubric may ever require, instruct, or rely on printed paper or physical photocopying.
- **100% Screen-Based Interactive Design**: All student handouts, role cards, barrier games, answer keys, teacher notes, and reflection tools must exist exclusively as responsive, interactive on-screen UI components (tab switchers, revealable answers, interactive barrier cards, and local auto-saving notes).
- **Zero 'Print to Teach' Dependencies**: Even when source training materials contain sections labeled *"Part 1: Student Handout"* or *"Part 2: Teacher Answer Keys"*, these must always be converted into fully interactive, on-screen browser experiences. Teachers arrive in the classroom with their laptop or tablet, students use their laptops or tablets, and all tasks are executed digitally on screen with zero paper waste.

### T. Automated Session Audit & A4 PDF Worksheet Setup Protocol (Audit S... / Audit Semester ...)
- **Universal Audit Command (`npm run audit -- "..."` or Natural Chat)**: Whenever the user sends an audit command (e.g., `Audit S1 AG M1 Ss 3`, `Audit Semester 1 Mod 1 AG Ss 3`, `Audit S3 AT M1 S5`), the assistant executes `node scripts/audit-session.js` across the target session.
- **8 Mandatory Quality Checks**:
  1. *Thematic Relevance & Subject Drift*: Ensures 100% topical coherence between session key terms and classroom exercises.
  2. *2-Hour Classroom Sufficiency Gauge*: Evaluates the pedagogical structure across 6 core communicative stages (`🟢 Optimal`, `🟡 Light`, or `🔴 Deficient`).
  3. *1:1 Title Parity & Schema (Rules 1.L & 1.P)*: Verifies exact session title alignment across course data, admin hub, and standalone admin portal.
  4. *Zero Academic Jargon & Prohibited Lexicon (Rule 1.I)*: Scans for prohibited pedagogical meta-labels and enforces strict prohibition of the term `"faculty"`.
  5. *Classroom Timings & Teacher Autonomy (Rule 1.Q)*: Detects and removes rigid minute breakdowns and timer emojis.
  6. *Pairwork Viability & Student B Peer Checklist*: Ensures active listening checklists exist for speaking simulations.
  7. *Digital Worksheet & Auto-Saving Notes*: Confirms local storage textareas (`window.saveLessonNote`), official PDF download buttons, and zero deprecated browser print buttons.
  8. *7-Page A4 PDF Lesson Worksheet Status*: Enforces the exact 7-page A4 PDF invariant (`docs/GSEA_S[X]_M[X]_[TRACK]_S[X]_Lesson_Worksheet.pdf`), verified via native macOS PDFKit (`doc.pageCount === 7`), and tracked in `imsmanifest.xml`.
- **Tri-Project Invariant Synchronization**: The audit engine and command runbook are synchronized permanently across `GSEA_semester_1`, `GSEA_semester_2`, and `GSEA_semester_3`.

## 3. Cohort Upgrade & Scaling Guide (e.g., April Cohort / 3 Groups)

When onboarding a new cohort or scaling up from 2 groups to 3 groups (Group A, Group B, Group C):

1. **Update `AGENTS.md`**:
   - Update Section 2 with new student names, group counts, faculty, and timetables.
2. **Update Data Structures in `index.html` & `admin.html`**:
   - Add `groupC` into `ADMIN_GROUPS_DATA` with the third teacher and student roster.
   - Add `groupC` slot schedules into `ADMIN_ROTA_SCHEDULES` for FE1, FE2, and FE3.
   - In both files, extend the rota rendering loop to include a third group row block:
     ```html
     <!-- Group C Rows -->
     <tr class="bg-slate-50/80 font-bold text-slate-800 text-[11px]">
       <td colspan="4" class="py-2 px-3 tracking-wide uppercase bg-slate-100">
         Group C (${...})
       </td>
     </tr>
     ```
3. **Validate & Build**:
   - Run `npm run package` to ensure Tailwind styles and asset manifests remain 100% verified.
